## ‚úÖ Notes
üü£ Notes Before We Dive In

Yes, the router is as open as your DMs. No passwords yet (it's just a lab).

If you break it, you fix it. Welcome to networking.

Expect mistakes, expect laughs, but most importantly ‚Äî expect to learn.

Yes, this router is wide open with no password.  

Don't worry ‚Äî it's a lab, and the only hacker here is probably me accidentally misconfiguring it.

## ‚úÖ Router Configuration




### Step 1: Viewing Existing Configuration

Router>en
Router#conf t
Router(config)#do show run

* üò® Ok, now stick with me as this is going to look pretty crazy, and not your ex kinda crazy. üò®*

-------------------------------------------

*‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏èNow you might be wondering, what am I looking at?! Trust me I thought the same, and if you didn't, you are the second coming of Steve Jobs or something‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è*

  üîé So focusing on this part of the command üîé

----------------------------------------------
interface FastEthernet0/0
 no ip address
 duplex auto
 speed auto
 shutdown

interface FastEthernet0/1
 no ip address
 duplex auto
 speed auto
 shutdown
---------------------------------------------
We see that there are two interfaces, FastEthernet0/0 and FastEthernet0/1 and that is great! We can finally connect... all the connections ‚Äî to the connections ‚Äî to the connections. Sorry, channeling my inner Cisco poet there.
****I meant to say is that we now have the option of assigning IP address to indiduval ports, which is good for connectivity and troubleshooting.

‚úÖ This is important! We found that FastEthernet0/0 is available, so we will assign the IP to this interface.




Step 2: Assigning an IP Address to FastEthernet0/0

--------------------------------------------
Router(config)#interface fastethernet0/0
Router(config-if)#ip address 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.0
Router(config-if)#no shutdown
--------------------------------------------

So cool, we now assigned our first IP to a port (Get the champagne this calls for celebrating!)
What you might have noticed, is that in the IP (192.168.0.1) is why did we use the number .1 in the last octet? As a rule of thumb in regards to subnetting, this is typically what is know as the 
network address and it what is used to identify the router. Sounds complicated but I'll explain more once we go to subnetting.

Expected Output:

------------------------------------------
%LINK-5-CHANGED: Interface FastEthernet0/0, changed state to up
%LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface FastEthernet0/0, changed state to up
------------------------------------------
üí¨ Router finally wakes up and says,

%LINK-5-CHANGED: Interface FastEthernet0/0, changed state to up

‚úÖ Nice! The router is alive. Frankenstein would be proud.

Step 3: Saving the Configuration
-----------------------------------------
Router(config-if)#end
Router#copy run start
Destination filename [startup-config]?
Building configuration...
[OK]
-----------------------------------------

‚ö†Ô∏è DON'T FORGET TO SAVE! ‚ö†Ô∏è
You will hate yourself tomorrow if you forget this step.


üü° Notes & Takeaways

.1 is traditionally used for the router in a network.

This is just a basic setup, we didn't do any VLANs, NAT, Routing Protocols, or Subnetting ‚Äî yet.

Yes, you'll probably mess it up once or twice. Good, that's how you learn.

‚úÖ Final Thoughts
Ok, we did it! We've officially become hackerman. Now go use this new skill, shock your IT friends, and definitely brag.
